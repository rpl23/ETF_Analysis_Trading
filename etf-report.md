## ABSTRACT

This research presents a systematic investigation into ETF price prediction and trading strategy implementation using machine learning techniques. By employing a dual-model Random Forest approach combined with comprehensive risk management frameworks, I develop a robust methodology for capturing market opportunities while maintaining strict risk controls. Our analysis encompasses eight major ETFs including SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, GLD, XLF, XLK, and XLE, providing insights into cross-asset relationships and sector-specific behavior patterns.

## INTRODUCTION

As ETFs continue to dominate modern investment landscapes, developing reliable frameworks for predicting their price movements becomes increasingly crucial. This research aims to construct a comprehensive methodology for forecasting ETF price dynamics while implementing practical trading strategies with robust risk management controls.

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Data Collection and Processing
The dataset, sourced from Yahoo Finance, comprises daily price and volume data for eight major ETFs from 2018 to 2024. The data was partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with careful consideration for temporal ordering to prevent look-ahead bias.

### Feature Engineering
```python
def create_features(df, window_short=5, window_long=20):
    features = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)

    # Process each ETF
    for etf in etf_list:
        # Get the closing price and volume columns
        price_col = f'{etf}_Close'
        vol_col = f'{etf}_Volume'

        # Returns
        features[f'{etf}_returns'] = df[price_col].pct_change()

        # Moving averages
        features[f'{etf}_MA_short'] = df[price_col].rolling(window=window_short).mean()
        features[f'{etf}_MA_long'] = df[price_col].rolling(window=window_long).mean()

        # Volatility
        features[f'{etf}_volatility'] = features[f'{etf}_returns'].rolling(window=window_short).std()

        # Volume features
        features[f'{etf}_volume_MA'] = df[vol_col].rolling(window=window_short).mean()
        features[f'{etf}_volume_ratio'] = df[vol_col] / features[f'{etf}_volume_MA']

    # Cross-ETF features
    # Relative strength vs SPY
    spy_returns = features['SPY_returns']
    for etf in [e for e in etf_list if e != 'SPY']:
        features[f'{etf}_rel_strength'] = features[f'{etf}_returns'] - spy_returns

    return features.dropna()
```

The adaptive system analyzes market conditions using multiple indicators:
- Trend strength metrics across different timeframes
- Volatility regime classification
- Cross-asset correlation patterns
- Market sentiment indicators derived from price and volume relationships
- Relative strength measures across asset classes

These adaptive features allow the strategy to:
- Adjust position sizes based on market volatility
- Modify entry and exit criteria according to trend strength
- Shift asset allocation based on regime changes
- Fine-tune risk parameters in response to market conditions
- Optimize trade timing based on market dynamics

### Model Architecture
The core prediction engine employs a dual-model Random Forest approach that balances conservative and aggressive prediction strategies. This architecture was specifically designed to address the challenge of achieving optimal precision-recall tradeoffs in ETF price prediction.

The dual-model system consists of two distinct Random Forest classifiers with carefully tuned parameters. Each model serves a specific purpose in the prediction framework:
```python
# Conservative model for stability
conservative_clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=4,
    min_samples_leaf=30,
    class_weight={0:1, 1:2},  # Slight bias towards positive class
    random_state=42
)


# Aggressive model for opportunity capture
aggressive_clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=6,
    min_samples_leaf=20,
    class_weight={0:1, 1:4},  # Stronger bias towards positive class
    random_state=42
)
```
The conservative model prioritizes prediction stability and risk management through its restricted depth and larger leaf size requirements. Its modest class weight bias (2:1) helps maintain balanced predictions while slightly favoring potential opportunities. This model excels at identifying high-probability trading signals with minimal false positives.

The aggressive model, with its greater depth and more pronounced class weight bias (4:1), is designed to capture more subtle market opportunities that the conservative model might miss. This model is particularly effective during trending markets where more aggressive positioning may be warranted.

The predictions from both models are combined using a weighted average approach, with the conservative model given a 70% weight and the aggressive model a 30% weight. This weighting scheme helps maintain overall strategy stability while still allowing for opportunistic trades when high-confidence signals emerge.

## RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

### Model Performance

Based on the final balanced model implementation, performance metrics across different ETFs:

1. Best Performers:
   - GLD: 72.1% accuracy, excellent recall (93.9%)
   - SPY: 68.2% accuracy, balanced metrics (81.8% precision, 74.8% recall)
   - XLF: 69.3% accuracy, strong precision (89.4%)
   - XLK: 65.1% accuracy, high recall (91.8%)

2. Moderate Performers:
   - QQQ: 60.9% accuracy, decent balance (78.9% precision, 63.3% recall)

3. Challenging Performers:
   - IWM: Lower accuracy (43.4%), struggles with recall
   - TLT: Poor recall (0.5%), suggesting difficulty predicting upward movements
   - XLE: High recall but lower precision, suggesting over-prediction of upward movements

### Trading Strategy Implementation

The trading strategy is an approach that combines model predictions with dynamic position sizing and risk management. The strategy focuses on the four best-performing ETFs (SPY, GLD, XLF, and XLK) identified through extensive backtesting and performance analysis.

#### Signal Generation and Confidence Assessment
The strategy begins with signal generation from the dual-model system. Each trade signal is evaluated based on:
- Combined model prediction probabilities
- Relative strength of the signal compared to historical patterns
- Current market regime conditions
- Cross-asset confirmation signals

These factors are synthesized into a confidence score that directly influences position sizing and risk allocation.

#### Portfolio Construction
```python
# Function to create and manage trading signals and positions
def create_trading_strategy(data, models, X_test_combined, confidence_threshold=0.6):
    # Initialize predictions DataFrame with the same timeframe as our test data
    # This will store all our signals, positions, and portfolio metrics
    predictions = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index[-len(X_test_combined):])

    # Generate trading signals for each ETF in our universe
    for etf in ['SPY', 'GLD', 'XLF', 'XLK']:
        model = models[etf]
        # Get probability predictions from our model
        # probas[:, 1] gives us probability of upward movement
        probas = model.predict_proba(X_test_combined)
        predictions[f'{etf}_prob'] = probas[:, 1]
        # Create binary trading signals (1 = buy, 0 = no position)
        # Only generate signal if confidence exceeds our threshold
        predictions[f'{etf}_signal'] = (probas[:, 1] > confidence_threshold).astype(int)

    # Set portfolio management parameters
    portfolio_size = 100000  # Starting with $100k portfolio
    max_position_size = 0.25  # Maximum 25% allocation per ETF
    
    # Calculate dynamic position sizes for each ETF
    for etf in ['SPY', 'GLD', 'XLF', 'XLK']:
        confidence = predictions[f'{etf}_prob']
        
        # Dynamic position sizing based on model confidence
        # Position size increases linearly with confidence above threshold
        # Example: 
        # - If confidence = 0.8 and threshold = 0.6:
        # - Position = $100k * 0.25 * (0.8 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6)
        # - Position = $100k * 0.25 * 0.2 / 0.4
        # - Position = $12.5k (12.5% of portfolio)
        predictions[f'{etf}_position'] = np.where(
            confidence > confidence_threshold,
            # Calculate position size when confidence exceeds threshold
            portfolio_size * max_position_size * (confidence - confidence_threshold) / 
            (1 - confidence_threshold),
            # No position if confidence below threshold
            0
        )

    # Risk management calculations
    # Track total portfolio exposure by summing all ETF positions
    predictions['total_exposure'] = predictions[[f'{etf}_position' 
        for etf in ['SPY', 'GLD', 'XLF', 'XLK']]].sum(axis=1)
    # Calculate remaining cash position
    predictions['cash'] = portfolio_size - predictions['total_exposure']

    # Final predictions DataFrame contains:
    # - Probability scores for each ETF
    # - Binary trading signals
    # - Position sizes in dollars
    # - Total portfolio exposure
    # - Remaining cash
    return predictions
```

The portfolio construction process incorporates several key features:
- Dynamic position sizing based on signal confidence
- Automated rebalancing triggers
- Correlation-aware position limits
- Liquidity-based allocation adjustments
- Sector exposure controls

This systematic approach ensures that the portfolio remains well-diversified while maximizing exposure to the highest-conviction opportunities.

### Risk Management Framework

1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum portfolio allocation: 80% of total capital
   - Maximum position size: 25% per ETF
   - Position scaling based on model confidence
   - Minimum cash reserve: 20%

The risk management framework operates on multiple levels, combining position-level controls with portfolio-wide risk monitoring. This multi-layered approach helps protect against both individual position risks and systematic market risks.

2. Risk Metrics Calculation and Monitoring:
```python
def calculate_risk_metrics(returns):
    metrics = {
        'Annualized Return': returns['total_return'].mean() * 252,
        'Annualized Volatility': returns['total_return'].std() * np.sqrt(252),
        'Sharpe Ratio': returns['total_return'].mean() / returns['total_return'].std() * 
            np.sqrt(252) if returns['total_return'].std() != 0 else 0,
        'Max Drawdown': (1 - returns['cumulative_return'] / 
            returns['cumulative_return'].cummax()).max(),
        'Win Rate': (returns['total_return'] > 0).mean()
    }
    return metrics
```

The risk monitoring system continuously tracks multiple risk dimensions:
- Position-level volatility and drawdown metrics
- Portfolio-level correlation dynamics
- Exposure concentrations across sectors and asset classes
- Aggregate portfolio risk metrics
- Market regime indicators

These metrics are used to dynamically adjust position sizes and overall portfolio exposure, ensuring the strategy maintains its target risk profile across different market conditions.

### Market Regime Adaptation

The strategy incorporates market regime awareness through a sophisticated adaptive feature system that responds to changing market conditions. This adaptation mechanism helps the strategy adjust its behavior across different market environments, from trending to mean-reverting markets, and from low to high volatility periods.

1. Adaptive Features and Market State Detection:
```python
def create_adaptive_features(df, window_short=5, window_long=20):
    features = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)

    for etf in etf_list:
        price = df[f'{etf}_Close']
        
        # Price momentum
        returns = price.pct_change()
        features[f'{etf}_trend_strength'] = (
            returns.rolling(window=window_long).mean() /
            returns.rolling(window=window_long).std()
        )

        # Distance from moving averages
        ma_short = price.rolling(window=window_short).mean()
        ma_long = price.rolling(window=window_long).mean()
        features[f'{etf}_ma_distance'] = (ma_short - ma_long) / ma_long

        # Volatility regime
        features[f'{etf}_vol_regime'] = returns.rolling(window=window_long).std()

    return features.dropna()
```

## CONCLUSION

This research demonstrates the effectiveness of a dual-model Random Forest approach for ETF trading, particularly in predicting traditional safe-haven assets and large-cap indices. Key findings include:

1. Asset Class Patterns:
   - Traditional safe-haven assets (GLD) show strong predictability
   - Large-cap indices (SPY, QQQ) are more predictable than small-caps (IWM)
   - Bonds (TLT) remain challenging to predict

2. Sector Patterns:
   - Financial sector (XLF) shows strong predictability
   - Tech sector (XLK) predictions favor recall over precision
   - Energy sector (XLE) shows high sensitivity but lower accuracy

Future research directions include:
1. Integration of alternative data sources
2. Enhancement of risk management frameworks
3. Development of high-frequency trading capabilities
